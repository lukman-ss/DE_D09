Installing Apache Airflow using Docker Desktop on Windows is similar to the process mentioned earlier. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for Windows using Docker Desktop:

1. **Install Docker Desktop**:
   Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Make sure to enable the WSL 2 backend during the installation for better performance.

2. **Create a Directory**:
   Create a directory on your local machine where you'll store your Airflow configuration and DAG files. For example, you can create a folder named `airflow` in your user's home directory.
2.1. Open Command Prompt AS Administrator
2.2. write cd %userprofile% in terminal
2.3. mkdir airflow

3. **Create a Docker Compose File**:
3.1. cd airflow
3.2. cat > docker-compose.yaml
3.3 paste this code 
   Inside the `airflow` directory, create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     webserver:
       image: apache/airflow:latest
       container_name: airflow_webserver
       restart: always
       environment:
         - AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@postgres/airflow
         - AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor
       volumes:
         - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
         - ./logs:/opt/airflow/logs
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"

     postgres:
       image: postgres:13
       container_name: airflow_postgres
       restart: always
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=airflow
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=airflow
         - POSTGRES_DB=airflow
       volumes:
         - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

   volumes:
     pgdata:
   ```

4. **Create Directories**:
   Inside the `airflow` directory, create two directories named `dags` and `logs`.
4.1 mkdir dags
4.2 mkdir logs

5. **Start Airflow Containers**:
   Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt), navigate to the `airflow` directory, and run the following command:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Access Airflow UI**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Airflow web interface. Log in with the default credentials (`username: airflow`, `password: airflow`).

7. **Managing DAGs**:
   Place your Airflow DAG files in the `dags` directory you created earlier. Airflow will automatically detect and schedule these DAGs.

That's it! You've now set up Apache Airflow using Docker Desktop on Windows. You can manage and monitor your workflows through the Airflow web interface.

Please remember that this is a basic setup. In a production environment, you would need to consider additional configuration and security measures
